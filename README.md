-----------------------------

📌 Master in Data Science and Applied Information, my goal is to leverage Data Science technologies to the benefit of the Environment. 

Since I embraced a Data Science carreer, I always have been inspired by companies like [@OceanCleanUp](https://theoceancleanup.com/) [@Recycleye](https://recycleye.com/) leveraging data science technologies to make a positive impact on the environment. (...)

### 🎓 Master Thesis Project
> *Data Driven Sustainability Assessment of Indoor Farming Operations*

I build a full-stack Environment Information System (EIS), from Data Acquisition with hardware monitoring system to Data Visualization on Tableau Software, by hosting and processing data on Amazon Web Service (AWS). The objective was to provide the environmental footprint of an indoor vertical farm using close-loop irrigation system, artificial lightning system and verticallity, evaluating the farm sustainablility on water, electrical and land footprint.

### 🔬 Academic Project
> *Hochschule Luzern (HSLU) pratical approach and data science interdisciplinarity*

We have gained hands-on experience on multiple filed of Data Science, such as Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Database Managment and benefit from several Data Science tool such as Tableau Software, AWS, Azure

### 🙆 Personal Project
> *Explore Spatial Data and opportunities to contribute in transitioning in a sustainable agriculture*

Seeking to merge my passion for Sustainable Agriculture and Data Science, lately I am exploring the power of Spatial Data, notably with QGIS. Here are some projects in that direction:
