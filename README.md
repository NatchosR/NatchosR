### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Master Student in Data Science and Applied Information at HSLU (Swiss University). 

I complete several fun and creative projects:
- Data Base Management -> Restaurant Reviews in the USA :fork_and_knife:
- Data Pipelines/Platforms -> Wildfires in California :fire:
- Machine Learning -> ML in Speed Dating :couplekiss:
- Deep Learning -> Recycling waste :recycle:

And more is about to come, as I am looking for a master thesis :smirk:
